### Snes9x GX with Retrode and XBOX360 controller support


### Retrode 2 ###
* Play your original SNES cartridges on your Wii using your original SNES controllers!
* The [Retrode 2](http://www.retrode.org) cartridge reader offers USB mass storage access for your SNES cartridges. This works out of the box on the Wii!
* With my driver you can also use your SNES gamepads on your Wii!
* Support for 4 players!
* Tested with various games: Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Streetfighter 2, Mortal Kombat, Doom, Wolfenstein, Super Bomberman, Contra 3...

### XBOX360 controller ### 
* Only XBOX360 **wired version** is supported (VID=0x045e, PID=0x028e)
* To enable XBOX controller: Settings -> Menu
* Currently only one XBOX360 controller is supported.
* You can switch players by pressing the XBOX button. The LED shows which player is selected.  

### HOWTO ###
* Connect your Retrode 2, the XBOX360 controller and your USB drives, then start Snes9x GX.
* To make sure the controller was correctly detected click on the logo, which opens the credits screen. See screenshot below.
* Do not unplug your USB controllers or USB drives after startup!

### Notes
* Original SNES Mouse is not supported. (I don't have one, but if you give me the RetrodeTest output I could add it...)
* Latest version also supports my _Speedlink Hornet USB Gamepad_: VID=0079, PID=0011. Various manufacturers use the same IDs, but with different button layouts. 
* I also maintain the [RetroArchWiiRetrode](https://github.com/revvv/RetroArchWiiRetrode/) fork.
