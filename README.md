### Snes9x GX with Retrode and XBOX360 controller support
Play your original SNES cartridges on your Wii using your original SNES controllers!

* The [Retrode 2](http://www.retrode.org) cartridge reader offers USB mass storage access for your SNES cartridges. This works out of the box on the Wii!
* With my driver you can also use your SNES gamepads on your Wii!
* Support for 4 players!
* Tested with various games: Super Mario World, Yoshi's Island, Streetfighter 2, Mortal Kombat, Doom, Wolfenstein, Super Bomberman...
* Connect your Retrode 2, then launch my apps. To make sure the Retrode 2 was correctly detected in Snes9x GX click on the logo. See screenshot below.

**XBOX360 controller** is now supported! (XBOX360 wired version only: VID=0x045e, PID=0x028e)
* If your controller does not show up on credits screen, please replug it.
* Do not unplug your controller once it is detected!

### Notes
* Original SNES Mouse is not supported. (I don't have one, but if you give me the RetrodeTest output I could add it...)
* I also maintain the [RetroArchWiiRetrode](https://github.com/revvv/RetroArchWiiRetrode/) fork.
